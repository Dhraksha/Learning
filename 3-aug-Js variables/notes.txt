Types of Variables:

There are 2 types of variables.

1. Local Variables :

If a variable is created inside a function, then it is known as local variable. 


The scope of the local variable is with in the function, which means, the local variables can be 
accessed only within the function. 


<html>
    <head>
        <body>
            <script>
                
                function f1(){
                    var a=10;  //local variable
                    var b=20;
                     console.log(a);
                     console.log(b);
                }f1();
                console.log(a)  //error
                console.log(b)
            
            </script>
        </body>
    </head>
</html>

2. Global Variables

A variable that is created outside of the functions is known as global 
variable. 

<html>
    <head>
        <body>
            <script>
                var a=10;  //global variable
                var b=20;
                function f1(){
                    console.log(a);
                    console.log(b);
                }f1();
                function f2(){
                    var c=30;
                    var d=40;
                    console.log(c);
                    console.log(d);
                }f2();

                console.log(a);
                console.log(b);
        </script>
       </body>
    </head>
</html>

Global variables can be accessed any where in the application.
